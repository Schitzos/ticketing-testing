## Config Block

```yaml
# Filled 2026-10-29

project:
  issue_prefix: "RBT"

tracker:
  type: "github"
  base_url: "https://github.com/tiket-sampai-nonton/rusuh-booking-mobile"
  board_id: "1"                    # org project "Rusuh Booking FE"

github:
  owner: "tiket-sampai-nonton"
  repo: "rusuh-booking-mobile"
  base_branch: "develop"           # feature → PR develop → PR main (D5.2)

ci:
  provider: "github-actions"
  required_checks:
    - "typecheck"
    - "lint"
    - "test"
    - "sonarcloud"
```

> **Branch pattern:** `feature/<issue-key>-<slug>` (e.g. `feature/RBT-050-booking-timer`).
> **Commit pattern:** Conventional Commits `<type>(<issue-key>): <message>` (e.g. `feat(RBT-050): add booking session timer`).

### Placeholder Guard

**RULE:** If any config value is still a placeholder (`<fill>`), the agent MUST stop and report:

> "Config block incomplete — cannot proceed. Missing values: [list of unfilled fields]"

**NEVER** use a placeholder as a literal value. A branch named `feature/<fill>-123-login` or a commit prefixed `<fill>-123` indicates a config error, not a valid ticket.

## Branch Naming

### Pattern
```
<type>/<issue-key>-<slug>
```

### Types
| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `feature` | New functionality |
| `fix` | Bug fixes |
| `chore` | Maintenance, refactoring |
| `spike` | Research, investigation |
| `docs` | Documentation only |

### Examples
```
feature/PROJ-123-payment-timer
fix/PROJ-456-null-pointer-checkout
chore/PROJ-789-upgrade-dependencies
spike/PROJ-101-evaluate-caching
```

### Rules
- Issue key MUST be present
- Slug MUST be lowercase kebab-case
- Slug SHOULD be descriptive but short (3-5 words max)

---

## Commit Messages

### Pattern
```
<type>(<scope>): <issue-key> <description>
```

### Types
| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes nor adds |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |

### Examples
```
feat(checkout): PROJ-123 add payment timer component
fix(auth): PROJ-456 handle null user in session check
refactor(api): PROJ-789 extract HTTP client to separate module
test(checkout): PROJ-123 add unit tests for payment timer
docs(readme): PROJ-101 update setup instructions
```

### Rules
- Issue key MUST be present
- Description MUST be imperative mood ("add", not "added" or "adds")
- Description SHOULD be lowercase (except proper nouns)
- Line length MAX 72 characters
