# IMPLEMENTATION-READINESS.md — Readiness Checklist

> GENESIS Phase 5 output. Final consistency check before implementation (`WORKFLOW.md`).
> Scope: **FE only** (Expo Universal). BE is a consumed contract delivered by another team.

## Overall Status

- **Project:** Rusuh Booking Tiket — Front-End (Expo Universal)
- **Date:** 2026-10-29
- **Status:** **CONDITIONAL GO**

```
Documentation:  ✅
Tasks:          ✅
Skills:         ✅
Blockers:       ⚠️  (no FE-internal P0; cross-team O1/O2/O4 open — mocked, non-blocking)
Infrastructure: ⚠️  (repo/CI not yet scaffolded — that IS RBT-001/005, the first work)

Overall:        CONDITIONAL GO — start on the critical path; mocks cover BE gaps
```

## 2. Task Readiness

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Epics | 9 |
| Total Stories | 44 |
| Stories with specs (AC) | 44/44 |
| Stories with estimates | 44/44 |
| Dependencies mapped | yes |
| Critical path identified | yes (E1→E2→E5→E6→E7→E8→E9) |

### Milestones
| Milestone | Scope | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| M1 Walking skeleton | E1+E2 | ready to start |
| M2 Discovery | E3+E4 | ready after E2 |
| M3 Booking spine | E5+E6 | ready after E2 |
| M4 Pay & deliver | E7+E8 | mock-first (D10.5) |
| M5 Release-ready | E9 | after features |

**Task Status:** ✅ Ready.

---

## 3. Skills Readiness

| Domain | Skill | Source | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| perf/RN | react-native-best-practices | local | ✅ |
| design | frontend-design | local | ✅ |
| e2e evidence | browser-recording | local | ✅ |
| EAS / Playwright / Maestro / OpenAPI codegen / web push / Midtrans | documented fallback (registry/docs at task time) | — | ⚠️ fallback |

**Skill conflicts:** none. **Skills Status:** ✅ All domains have a skill or documented fallback.

---

## 4. Blockers

### P0 (FE-internal, must resolve before any work)
_None._ The FE build has no internal P0 — mocks decouple it from BE.

### P1 / External dependencies (cross-team — mocked, non-blocking)
| ID | Blocks | Owner | Status | FE mitigation |
|----|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| O1 | FE-NEED endpoints (buyer-set, anonymous join, `remainingTickets`, `description` JSON, profile-complete flag) | BE team | Open (requested) | Mock adapter behind the real ports (RBT-014) |
| O2 | Midtrans `createAttempt` + page-token contract shapes | FE↔BE | Open (to discuss) | Mock `PaymentRepository` + SNAP simulator (RBT-065, D10.5) |
| O4 | `/browse` server filter/sort + event history endpoint | BE team | Open | Client-side filtering until delivered |

**Blocker Status:** ⚠️ No FE P0 open; 3 cross-team deps tracked and mocked.

---

## 5. Infrastructure Readiness

| Item | Status | Note |
|------|--------|------|
| Repo / monorepo scaffold | ❌ | **This is RBT-001** — the first story |
| CI pipeline (GitHub Actions + SonarCloud) | ❌ | **This is RBT-005** — PIPELINE.md is the spec |
| EAS config (dev/prod channels) | ❌ | Lands with RBT-005/084 |
| Environments (develop/main) | ⚠️ planned | Per D5.2 — provisioned during E1 |
| Secrets strategy | ✅ documented | SECURITY.md D7.5; no secrets in `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` |

> Infrastructure is "not ready" by design: **standing up the repo + CI is literally the first epic (E1)**, not a pre-req that blocks starting.

**Infrastructure Status:** ⚠️ Expected — scaffolding is the first work item.

---

## 6. Go/No-Go Checklist

### Must Have (blocking)
- [x] No FE-internal P0 blockers
- [x] Core docs verified (ARCHITECTURE, API-CONTRACT, FE-Flow)
- [x] Task list complete with estimates + critical path
- [ ] CI pipeline working — **is RBT-005 (first epic), not a pre-req**
- [ ] Dev environment working — **is RBT-001 (first epic)**

### Should Have
- [x] All documentation verified
- [x] Skills identified (or fallback) for all tasks
- [x] Security checklist reviewed (SECURITY.md)
- [x] Mock strategy for every BE dependency (O1/O2/O4)

---

## 7. Decision

**Status:** **CONDITIONAL GO**

**Rationale:** The GENESIS documentation package is complete and internally consistent (H1–H4 passed), the task breakdown is fully specified with a clear critical path, and every backend dependency is decoupled via mock adapters behind the real ports — so the FE team can start immediately on the critical path without waiting on BE. The only ❌ items (repo scaffold, CI) are **the first stories themselves** (RBT-001, RBT-005), not external pre-requisites. This is a GO for implementation, conditional only on treating E1 (Foundations) as the literal first step.

**Can start now:**
- E1 Foundations (RBT-001…005) — monorepo, Expo app, Clean-Arch packages, tokens, CI skeleton.
- Then E2 (API layer + mock adapters), unblocking E3/E4/E5 in parallel.

**Must resolve before affected features (not before start):**
- O2 (Midtrans contract) before M4 payment goes real — mock covers it until then.
- O1 FE-NEED endpoints before those flows go real — mocked until then.

---

## 8. Next Steps (if GO)

1. [ ] Scaffold the monorepo + Expo app (RBT-001) and `set_project` to the new tree.
2. [ ] Stand up the CI skeleton (RBT-005) per PIPELINE.md.
3. [ ] Build E2 API layer + mock adapters (RBT-010…014, incl. mock PaymentRepository seed).
4. [ ] Open the parallel batch E3/E4/E5 once E2 interfaces are frozen.
5. [ ] Follow `.genesis/workflow/WORKFLOW.md` per story (Single-ticket mode default).
