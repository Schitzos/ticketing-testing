# TEMPLATES.md — Task Dispatch Templates

> Copy-paste templates for dispatching agents.
> Fill `{...}` placeholders with actual values.

**Note:** These are **task dispatch templates** (copy-paste prompts for dispatching agents).
For **document templates** (ARCHITECTURE.md, SECURITY.md, TASK-LIST.md, etc.),
see the `TEMPLATES/` directory — those are used throughout GENESIS Phases 2-5.

---

## 2. Story Task (single ticket)

```
Implement {KEY}: {description}

Spec: {link or "attached below"}

Pre-work:
1. Confirm spec is approved (if not, STOP)
2. Check IMPLEMENTATION-READINESS.md for blockers
3. Identify unknown domains in task
4. Load skills if needed (SKILLS-PROTOCOL.md)
5. Log skills loaded

Implementation:
6. Transition issue → In Progress
7. Create branch: feature/{KEY}-{slug}
8. Implement against spec — affected files ONLY
9. Write tests with real assertions
10. Commit: type(scope): {KEY} description
11. Run: type-check + lint + tests
12. Push branch (do NOT open PR yet)

Review (Phase 3.5):
13. Run AI review (7 perspectives):
    - Acceptance criteria satisfied?
    - Architecture boundaries respected?
    - API contracts followed?
    - Edge cases from EDGE-CASES.md handled?
    - Security (no secrets, input validation)?
    - Test coverage adequate?
    - Style matches RULES.md?
14. If review finds issues: fix and re-review (max 2 iterations)
15. If review PASS after ≤2 iterations: continue
16. If review FAIL after 2 iterations: escalate to human, STOP

PR (only after review PASS):
17. Open PR into base branch: [{KEY}] description
18. Wait for CI green
19. Run security checklist (if applicable)
20. Capture live evidence (if user-facing)
21. Report PR URL and STOP — await G3 approval

Do NOT merge before G3 approval. After G3, use Post-G3 Merge template.
If spec is unclear, STOP and escalate.
If skill conflicts with project rules, adapt or escalate.
```

---

## 3. Bug Task

```
Fix {KEY}: {bug title}

Repro:
1. {Step 1}
2. {Step 2}

Expected: {expected behavior}
Actual: {actual behavior}

1. Reproduce the bug (confirm it exists)
2. Identify root cause
3. Check if related skill exists
4. Transition issue → In Progress
5. Create branch: fix/{KEY}-{slug}
6. Write a test that FAILS before the fix
7. Fix the code
8. Confirm test PASSES after fix
9. Run full test suite for affected area
10. Push branch (do NOT open PR yet)

Review (Phase 3.5):
11. Run AI review (7 perspectives):
    - Does fix address root cause, not just symptom?
    - Could fix cause regressions elsewhere?
    - Are edge cases around the bug handled?
    - Is the fix consistent with architecture?
    - API contract conformance? (could fix accidentally alter response shape?)
    - Is the test sufficient to prevent recurrence?
    - Style matches RULES.md?
12. If review finds issues: fix and re-review (max 2 iterations)
13. If review PASS: continue
14. If review FAIL after 2 iterations: escalate to human, STOP

PR (only after review PASS):
15. Open PR
16. Wait for CI green
17. Capture evidence showing the fix
18. Report PR URL and STOP — await G3 approval

Do NOT merge before G3 approval. After G3, use Post-G3 Merge template.
```

---

## 4. Spike Task

```
Spike {KEY}: {research question}

Time box: {X hours}

Context:

- What decision it will inform

Deliverables:
1. Summary of findings
2. Recommendation (Option A vs B vs C with rationale)
3. ADR note if a decision is made
4. Follow-up tasks identified (if any)
5. Skills discovered (if any new skills needed)

Do NOT write production code.

Report findings and STOP.
```

---

## 5. Worker Brief (for parallel batch)

```
You are a worker for issue {KEY}.

Issue: {KEY}
Spec: {link or inline}

Files you may change:

1. Transition → In Progress
2. Branch: feature/{KEY}-{slug}
3. Implement + tests (listed files ONLY)
4. Apply skill patterns where relevant
5. Commit with issue key
6. Push branch (do NOT open PR yet)

Review (Phase 3.5):
7. Run AI review (7 perspectives: AC, architecture, contract, edge cases, security, tests, style)
8. If issues found: fix and re-review (max 2 iterations)
9. If PASS: continue. If FAIL after 2: escalate, STOP.

PR (only after review PASS):
10. Open PR: [{KEY}] {title}
11. Wait for CI
12. Capture evidence

## 6. CI Fix Loop

```
Fix CI for {KEY}.

PR: {PR URL}
Failing gate: {name}
Error: {message}

1. Read the failure carefully
2. If error is unfamiliar:
   - skill_search(query="{error type} {technology}")
   - If not found: skill_discover(query="{error}")
   - Apply fix pattern from skill
3. Fix the code
4. Commit: fix(scope): {KEY} fix {gate}
5. Push
6. Wait for CI
7. Loop (max 3 iterations)
8. If green → report success
9. If still failing after 3 → escalate to human

Do NOT merge.
Max 2 skill searches per topic (see R075).
```

---

## 7. Parallel Batch Dispatch

```
Work in parallel:
- {KEY1}: {description1}
- {KEY2}: {description2}
- {KEY3}: {description3}

Pre-checks:
1. All specs are approved
2. File sets are disjoint (no overlap)
3. No dependencies between issues
4. Host resources adequate (resource_status)

Skill discovery:
5. Identify all domains across tasks
6. Load skills once (don't repeat per worker)
7. Include skill context in each worker brief

Dispatch one worker per issue using Worker Brief template.
Each worker reports PR URL and STOPs.
After all complete, verify CIs + evidence, then report consolidated status.

Do NOT merge PRs until G3 approval for each.
After G3 approval, use Post-G3 Merge template for each.
```

---

## 7a. Post-G3 Merge (Phase 5)

```
Merge approved PR for {KEY}.

G3 approval received: {date/confirmation}
PR: {PR URL}

1. Confirm G3 was approved (do not proceed without approval)
2. Merge PR to base branch
3. Transition issue → Done
4. Update any affected docs (if needed)
5. Report: "{KEY} merged and Done"

This is Phase 5 execution. Only run after G3 approval.
```

---

## 8. GENESIS Kickoff

```
Start GENESIS for: {project name}

Raw requirement:
{paste requirement or link to document}

Follow GENESIS.md workflow:
1. Phase 1: Analyze the requirement
2. Gate H1: Conduct critical grooming (GROOMING-CHECKLIST.md)
3. Phase 2: Generate all documentation
4. Gate H2: Wait for doc verification
5. Phase 3: Decompose into tasks
6. Gate H3: Wait for task verification
7. Phase 4: Discover skills, generate RULES.md + AGENTS.md
8. Gate H4: Wait for skill verification
9. Phase 5: Run readiness checklist
10. Gate H5: Wait for final approval

Use GROOMING-PROTOCOL.md behavior — challenge decisions, don't just accept.

Output all docs to: `.genesis/docs/` (see GENESIS.md "Output Layout" — numbered 01-08 for the phase/gate trail, un-numbered for the deliverable set, AGENTS.md at the repo root).
