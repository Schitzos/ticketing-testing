## F001 — Ambiguous or Incomplete Spec

**Symptoms:**
- Spec says "handle errors" but doesn't define which errors
- Multiple interpretations possible
- Missing acceptance criteria
- Referenced doc doesn't exist

**Recovery:**
```
1. STOP implementation immediately
2. Document the ambiguity precisely:
   - What is unclear
   - What interpretations are possible
   - What decision is needed
3. Transition issue to Blocked
4. Add comment: "Blocked: spec ambiguity — [description]"
5. Escalate to spec owner
6. Wait for clarification
7. Update spec with clarification
8. Resume only after spec is clear
```

**Rule:** NEVER implement a guess.

---

## F002 — Hard Dependency Unresolved

**Symptoms:**
- Feature depends on API not yet built
- Feature depends on decision not yet made
- Feature blocked by open P0
- External service unavailable

**Recovery:**
```
1. STOP implementation
2. Identify the blocking dependency
3. Check IMPLEMENTATION-READINESS.md for known blockers
4. Transition issue to Blocked
5. Add comment: "Blocked by: [dependency] — [why]"
6. Link to the blocking issue if one exists
7. Notify dependency owner
8. Resume only when dependency is resolved
```

**Rule:** Don't work around blockers with hacks.

---

## F003 — CI Failure Persists

**Symptoms:**
- Build fails repeatedly
- Tests fail after 3 fix attempts
- Flaky test that can't be stabilized
- Environment issue

**Recovery:**
```
1. Document all fix attempts:
   - What was tried
   - What the result was
   - Why it didn't work
2. Capture CI logs
3. Search for relevant skill:
   - skill_search(query="{error type}")
   - skill_discover(query="{error}")
4. If skill found, apply and retry once
5. If still failing after 3 total attempts:
   - Transition issue to Blocked
   - Add comment: "CI blocked: [summary of attempts]"
   - Attach logs
   - Escalate to human
6. Do NOT merge with red CI
```

**Rule:** Max 3 fix attempts, then escalate.

---

## F004 — Merge Conflict

**Symptoms:**
- Git reports conflicts when merging/rebasing
- Multiple PRs touched same files
- Base branch moved significantly

**Recovery:**
```
1. Identify conflicting files
2. Assess conflict complexity:
   - Simple: whitespace, import order
   - Medium: logic changes in same area
   - Complex: architectural changes
3. For Simple conflicts:
   - Resolve locally
   - Run tests
   - Push
4. For Medium/Complex conflicts:
   - Pull latest base
   - Understand both changes
   - Resolve preserving both intents
   - Run full test suite
   - Get review on conflict resolution
5. If resolution is unclear:
   - Escalate to both change authors
   - Do NOT guess at resolution
```

**Rule:** When in doubt about conflict resolution, escalate.

---

## F005 — Cannot Capture Evidence

**Symptoms:**
- Test environment down
- Screenshot tool failing
- Feature requires manual testing
- Evidence would expose sensitive data

**Recovery:**
```
1. Identify why evidence can't be captured
2. For environment issues:
   - Check environment status
   - Wait and retry
   - Use alternative environment if available
3. For tool issues:
   - Search for alternative capture skill
   - Use different screenshot method
4. For manual-only features:
   - Document manual test steps
   - Request human to capture evidence
5. For sensitive data:
   - Use mock/test data
   - Redact sensitive portions
   - Document what was redacted and why
6. Escalate if no evidence possible
```

**Rule:** Evidence must be from live run, not mocked screenshots.

---

## F006 — Implementation Exceeds Spec

**Symptoms:**
- Agent finds edge case not in spec
- Implementation requires change to other files
- Discovered that spec is incomplete

**Recovery:**
```
1. STOP implementation
2. Document what was discovered:
   - What edge case / requirement was found
   - Why current spec doesn't cover it
   - What changes would be needed
3. Do NOT implement beyond spec
4. Do NOT modify files outside spec
5. Add comment: "Discovered: [issue] — spec update needed"
6. Escalate to spec owner
7. Wait for spec update or explicit approval
8. Resume only with updated scope
```

**Rule:** Spec is the contract. Changes require renegotiation.

---

## F007 — Required Skill Not Found

**Symptoms:**
- Technology not in agent's knowledge
- skill_search returns nothing
- skill_discover returns nothing
- Available skills don't match need

**Recovery:**
```
1. Confirm skill is truly needed (not just unfamiliar)
2. Search with different keywords:
   - Try synonyms
   - Try broader category
   - Try specific error message
3. If still not found:
   - Document what skill is needed
   - Document what was searched
   - Escalate to human
4. Human options:
   - Provide guidance directly
   - Install a skill
   - Accept that agent works without skill
5. Do NOT proceed without skill if task requires it
```

**Rule:** Max 2 skill searches per topic, then escalate (see R075).

---

## F008 — Phase Exceeds Time Limit

**Symptoms:**
- Spec taking > 2 hours
- Implementation taking > 1 day
- CI verification taking > 2 hours
- Agent spinning without progress
- AI review (Phase 3.5) taking > 30 minutes

**Recovery:**
```
1. Check progress:
   - What has been done
   - What remains
   - Why it's taking long
2. Identify cause:
   - Scope larger than expected
   - Blocked by something
   - Approach not working
3. If scope issue:
   - Document actual scope
   - Propose scope reduction
   - Escalate for re-scoping
4. If blocked:
   - Switch to appropriate F00X protocol
5. If approach failing:
   - Document what was tried
   - Propose alternative approach
   - Get approval before switching
6. If genuinely complex:
   - Document progress
   - Provide estimate for completion
   - Get approval to continue or stop
```

**Rule:** Escalate at time limit, don't silently continue.

**For GENESIS sessions:** If context is lost during a long GENESIS run (5-10 hours), see `GENESIS.md §Long-Session Guidance`. Recovery starts from the last completed phase using saved artifacts, not from the beginning.

## F009 — Human Gate Rejected

**Symptoms:**
- Gate G1 (spec) rejected
- Gate G2 (design) rejected
- Gate G3 (evidence) rejected
- Gate G4 (release) rejected
- Human says "no" or requests changes

**Recovery:**
```
1. Acknowledge rejection
2. Capture feedback:
   - What was wrong
   - What needs to change
   - Any specific guidance
3. Identify rejection type:
   - Minor: small fixes needed
   - Major: significant rework
   - Fundamental: wrong direction
4. For Minor:
   - Make fixes
   - Resubmit for review
5. For Major:
   - Return to previous phase
   - Rework significantly
   - Resubmit
6. For Fundamental:
   - Stop current approach
   - Discuss alternative direction
   - May need to restart from earlier phase
```

**Rule:** Rejection is feedback, not failure. Learn and adapt.

---

## F010 — Unresolved Grooming Contradiction

**Symptoms:**
- Human gave conflicting answers
- Contradiction flagged but not resolved
- Human insisted on both contradictory things

**Recovery:**
```
1. Document both contradictory statements:
   - "[Statement A]" (from section X)
   - "[Statement B]" (from section Y)
   - Why they conflict
2. Present options:
   - Option 1: Prioritize A (with consequence)
   - Option 2: Prioritize B (with consequence)
   - Option 3: Alternative that resolves both
3. Request explicit decision
4. If human insists on both:
   - Explain why both cannot be true
   - Document that contradiction was flagged
   - Proceed with human's explicit choice
   - Note the risk in documentation
5. Do NOT proceed with unacknowledged contradiction
```

**Rule:** Contradictions must be resolved or explicitly accepted.

## F011 — AI Review Not Converging

**Symptoms:**
- Phase 3.5 REVIEW has failed in both iterations
- Code compiles and tests pass locally (CI has not run yet)
- But correctness, architecture, or contract issues remain
- Agent cannot resolve findings within max iterations

**Recovery:**
```
1. Do NOT open the PR
2. Document review findings from both iterations:
   - What each perspective found
   - What was attempted to fix it
   - Why the fix didn't satisfy the review
3. Attach findings to issue as a comment
4. Transition issue → Blocked
5. Add comment: "Blocked: AI review not converging — [summary]"
6. Escalate to human with:
   - Review findings (all perspectives)
   - Fix attempts from each iteration
   - What decision is needed (scope change? design change? manual review?)
7. Wait for human guidance
8. Resume only after human resolves:
   - Human approves opening PR despite findings (with rationale)
   - Human provides guidance for a fix approach
   - Human changes scope/design to avoid the issue
```

**Rule:** Never open a PR when review has not passed. A passing CI is not a passing review.

**Difference from F003:**
- F011 fires **before CI runs** (before PR opens). Code compiles and unit tests pass locally, but the AI review found correctness, architecture, or contract issues. CI hasn't run yet.
- F003 fires **after CI runs** (after PR opens). The build or tests failed in the CI pipeline.

## Escalation Path

For all failures, the escalation path is:

```
1. Agent attempts recovery per protocol
2. If recovery fails → Document attempt
3. Escalate to human with:
   - Failure code
   - What happened
   - What was tried
   - What decision is needed
4. Wait for human guidance
5. Apply guidance
6. Resume or close as directed
```

---

## Recovery Log Template

When recovering from any failure:

```markdown
## Recovery Log: {KEY} - {F00X}

### Failure
- Code: F00X
- Time: {timestamp}
- Phase: {phase}
- Description: {what happened}
