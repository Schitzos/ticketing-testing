## How to Use

1. Agent asks questions section by section
2. Agent captures answers
3. Agent challenges weak or risky answers
4. Human justifies or adjusts
5. Move to next section only when current is complete
6. All sections must be addressed before proceeding

## Section 1: BUSINESS

> Understanding the why, who, and what.

### Questions

```
1.1 WHO are the target users?
    - Primary persona (main user type)
    - Secondary personas (other user types)
    - Admin/operator personas (if any)

1.2 WHAT are the business goals?
    - Primary KPI (key success metric)
    - Secondary KPIs
    - How will success be measured?

1.3 WHAT is the MVP scope?
    - Must-have features (launch blockers)
    - Should-have features (important but not blocking)
    - Nice-to-have features (future phases)
    - Explicitly out of scope

1.4 WHAT is the timeline?
    - Target launch date
    - Hard deadline or flexible?
    - Milestones between now and launch

1.5 ARE there compliance/regulatory requirements?
    - GDPR (EU data protection)
    - PCI-DSS (payment card data)
    - HIPAA (health data)
    - SOC 2 (security controls)
    - Industry-specific regulations
    - Data residency requirements

1.6 WHO are the stakeholders?
    - Decision makers
    - Technical reviewers
    - Business reviewers
    - End users for UAT
```

### Challenge Points
- Vague personas → push for specifics
- No KPIs → how will you know if it's successful?
- Everything is "must-have" → that's not prioritization
- Aggressive timeline + large scope → contradiction

## Section 2: ARCHITECTURE

> System structure and boundaries.

### Questions

```

    - Microservices (multiple deployables)
    - Serverless (function-based)
    - Hybrid (combination)

2.2 WHAT is the repository structure?
    - Monorepo (all code in one repo)
    - Polyrepo (separate repos per service)
    - Hybrid (shared libs in one, services in many)

2.3 HOW is frontend/backend split?
    - Monolithic (SSR, templates)
    - SPA + API (separate frontend and backend)
    - Mobile + API (native apps)
    - Multiple clients (web + mobile + API)

2.4 WHAT database strategy?
    - Single relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
    - Single document (MongoDB, DynamoDB)
    - Multi-database (OLTP + OLAP)
    - Database per service
    - Specific database choices and why

2.5 WHAT caching strategy?
    - No caching (simplicity)
    - Application-level (in-memory)
    - Distributed cache (Redis, Memcached)
    - CDN caching (static assets)
    - Cache invalidation strategy

2.6 DO you need a message queue / event bus?
    - No async processing needed
    - Simple queue (SQS, RabbitMQ)
    - Event streaming (Kafka, Kinesis)
    - Pub/sub (SNS, Google Pub/Sub)

2.7 WHAT third-party integrations?
    - Payment providers
    - Auth providers
    - Email/SMS services
    - Analytics services
    - Other external APIs
```

### Challenge Points

    - Combination

3.3 WHAT authentication pattern?
    - Session-based
    - JWT (stateless tokens)

```

### Challenge Points
- No state management strategy → will become chaotic
- REST + GraphQL without clear use cases → unnecessary complexity
- JWT without refresh strategy → security risk
- No error taxonomy → inconsistent error handling

## Section 4: TECH STACK

> Specific technology choices. Challenge trendy picks and surface hidden costs.

### Questions

```
4.1 WHAT language(s)?
    - Backend language(s)
    - Frontend language(s)
    - Why these choices?

4.2 WHAT framework(s)?
    - Backend framework
    - Frontend framework
    - Why these choices?

4.3 TEAM EXPERTISE — does the team have production experience?
    - Who on the team has shipped production code with this stack?
    - If no one, what's the learning ramp-up plan?
    - Is this a learning project disguised as a product?
    - Who owns the risk if the team can't deliver?

4.4 MAINTENANCE & LONGEVITY
    - Is this technology actively maintained?
    - When was the last major release? Last security patch?
    - What's the upgrade/migration path when major versions drop?
    - Who owns the risk if the project is abandoned?

4.5 LICENSING & COMMERCIAL USE
    - What license (MIT, Apache, GPL, proprietary)?
    - Any restrictions on commercial use or distribution?
    - Any dependencies with viral licenses (GPL)?
    - Any paid features that will be needed at scale?

4.6 WHAT UI library / design system?

    - Existing design system or new?

4.7 WHAT testing frameworks?
    - Unit testing
    - Integration testing
    - E2E testing
    - Contract testing

4.8 WHAT build tools?
    - Package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm)
    - Bundler (Vite, Webpack, esbuild)
    - Task runner
    - Monorepo tools (if applicable)
```

### Challenge Points
- Framework choice without team expertise → training cost, delivery risk
- "We chose X because someone read about it" → probe for production experience
- Multiple languages without justification → hiring complexity
- Technology chosen for hype, not fit → ask "why this over alternatives?"
- No testing framework decisions → will be ad-hoc
- Exotic build tools → maintenance burden
- Unmaintained dependencies → future security/compatibility risk
- GPL dependencies in commercial product → licensing landmine
- Framework with frequent breaking changes → upgrade tax

### Red Flag Responses
- "It's popular right now" → Who on team has production experience?
- "We'll learn as we go" → What's the budget for learning? Who owns delivery risk?
- "Everyone uses it" → Does it fit THIS problem? What are the alternatives?
- "The docs are great" → Docs ≠ production experience. Who's done this before?
- "It's the future" → What happens if it isn't? What's the exit strategy?
