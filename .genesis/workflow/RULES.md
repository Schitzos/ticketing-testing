  guidance: |
    PROCEED without asking for:
    - Packages already in the project's dependency list
    - Packages explicitly named in the spec or ARCHITECTURE.md
    - Direct dependencies of packages already approved (peer deps)
    
    ASK before adding:
    - Packages not in the project or spec
    - Packages with large footprint (>500KB)
    - Packages with known security history
    - Alternative packages when one already exists (e.g., adding moment when date-fns is used)
